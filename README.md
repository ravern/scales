# Scales
Helping my friend practice his scales.

## Purpose
My friend plays some awesome piano. However, he needed a way to
reliably randomise scales for him to practice. Thus, he enlisted
my help to make a quick scales generator for him, and this is what
I came up with.

## Stack
I used HTML, CSS and some vanilla JavaScript, along with jQuery
because I'm not totally insane.
